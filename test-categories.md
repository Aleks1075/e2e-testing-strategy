## Discussion on Test Categories

### Martin Fowler's Test Categories

- **Unit Tests**:

  - Focus on testing individual components in isolation.
  - **Example**: `task.unit.test.ts` checks if individual methods in the `Task` class work correctly.

- **Integration Tests**:

  - Ensure that different components work together as expected.
  - **Example**: `app.integration.test.ts` tests how task management and categorization components interact.

- **Broad-Stack Tests**:

  - Simulate real user interactions across the entire application.
  - **Note**: Not implemented in this project, but would cover end-to-end scenarios.

- **Component Tests**:
  - Test more complex parts of the system in isolation.
  - **Example**: Could involve testing several methods within the `Task` class together.

### Conclusion

The tests implemented cover both unit and integration levels, ensuring that individual components work correctly on their own and when combined. Expanding the test suite to include broad-stack tests and more complex component tests could further strengthen the coverage.
