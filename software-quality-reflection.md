## Software Quality Reflection

### Internal Quality

- My unit tests help manage the complexity of the code and keep it maintainable. By focusing on testing individual functions and methods, I ensure that the code remains simple and easy to work with.

### External Quality

- The code coverage analysis I performed is a key part of ensuring external quality. High coverage means that most parts of the app are tested and should work as expected for the user.
- To further improve external quality, adding load and performance tests would be beneficial.

### How to Improve

- **Increase Coverage**: I should aim to cover more of the code, especially in critical areas that affect user experience.
- **Edge Case Tests**: Adding more tests for unusual scenarios can help catch issues that might otherwise be missed.
- **Load and Performance Testing**: Introducing these tests would help ensure the app works well even under heavy usage.

### Conclusion

By focusing on both internal and external quality through my testing strategy, I’m ensuring that the app is reliable, maintainable, and user-friendly. There’s always room for improvement, and these steps will help me continue to enhance software quality.
