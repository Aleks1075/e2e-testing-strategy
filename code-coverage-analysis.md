## Code Coverage Analysis

### Type of Mutation Testing Used

- **Tool Used**: Jest's built-in coverage feature (`npx jest --coverage`) was used as a simplified method to evaluate the effectiveness of the test suite.

### Summary of Coverage

- **Statements**: 73.07% covered
- **Branches**: 66.66% covered
- **Functions**: 66.66% covered
- **Lines**: 74.46% covered

### Analysis

The code coverage analysis shows that the majority of the application is covered by tests, particularly the `task.ts` file, which has 100% coverage. However, the `app.ts` file has some areas that are not fully covered, particularly lines 27-36, 45, and 53-58.

### Action Plan

To improve coverage, additional tests should be written to cover the uncovered lines in `app.ts`, especially focusing on the logic and conditions that are not currently tested. This will ensure that the application is robust and that all critical paths are verified by the test suite.

### Conclusion

Overall, the current test suite provides good coverage, but there is room for improvement in certain areas.
